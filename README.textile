*Author: "jammyWolf"

h2. Summary

"This project":http://github.com/jammyWolf/zookeeper_dashboard uses Django framework and the zc.zk and kazoo bindings to provide a dashboard for a ZooKeeper ensemble (cluster).
Plus, the web design is contributed by Plunt Hunt's project-http://github.com/phunt/zookeeper_dashboard

* Configration support auth_data and multiple clusters
* Clusters's leader server infomation
* the info of each child node and display tree of a certain path

h3. What's Apache ZooKeeper?

From the "official site":http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/: "ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications."

It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols.

h2. Requirements

* Django 1.0+

h2. Usage

Add a path zkadmin/servers.py, follow the example in that file.

* ZOOKEEPER_SERVERS - host:port(,host:port)* of all servers in your cluster. This is the same information that you provide in your ZooKeeper client configuration.

then start the django server

Finally open a link in your browser to the server: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/":http://127.0.0.1:8000/

ZooKeeper client output is written to "cli_log.txt".

h2. Limitations

ACLs are supported by kazoo. Adding auth_data in zkadmin/servers.py for each cluster.
